## Key Topics Covered:
- Definition of Intelligent Automation (IA) as orchestrated Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
- Quantitative benefits of IA: Operating cost reduction (25-40%), revenue growth, increased speed/velocity (processes ~4x faster, 24/7 operation).
- Qualitative benefits of IA: Improved customer experience, enhanced human capital return, better employee morale, accelerated innovation, improved process quality (accuracy, controls, standardization), flexibility, and scalability.
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): Implementation costs (software/hardware rollout, governance), maintenance costs (licenses, labor, upgrades), and ancillary costs (monitoring, training, switching).
- Strategic Implementation for ROI Maximization:
    - Selection of appropriate processes (based on nature, volume, effort, potential value).
    - Identifying optimal automation approach (RPA vs. AI vs. IA).
    - Managing enterprise-wide change (automation roadmap, governance structures like CoE, IT readiness, changing employee mindsets).

## Summary:
This Deloitte white paper, in association with Blue Prism, details how organizations can calculate and maximize Return on Investment (ROI) from Intelligent Automation (IA), defined as the synergy of RPA and AI. It emphasizes that IA yields substantial benefits beyond direct labor savings, such as operational efficiencies (cost reduction, increased throughput, better scale) and improved quality (accuracy, standardization). While not specific to DevSecOps, the paper's focus on accurate processing, governance, and streamlined communication indirectly supports security principles vital for DevSecOps environments.

## Relevance to Agentic DevSecOps:
Intelligent Automation, as described by combining RPA and AI, is a foundational concept for advanced AI agent systems. The comprehensive ROI framework presented in this paper—encompassing quantitative/qualitative benefits, Total Cost of Ownership, and strategic implementation steps—is directly transferable to planning and justifying investments in agentic DevSecOps. AI agents in DevSecOps are designed to deliver similar outcomes: operational efficiency (e.g., automating CI/CD pipeline tasks, continuous security scanning, automated testing), improved software quality (e.g., early defect detection, consistent security policy enforcement), and enhanced security posture (e.g., proactive threat identification, automated incident response). This paper provides a robust model for assessing the business value of such agentic systems.

## Key Takeaways / Actionable Insights:
- **Holistic Benefit Articulation:** When proposing or evaluating agentic DevSecOps solutions, use this framework to articulate a full spectrum of benefits, including quantitative (e.g., reduced manual effort in security reviews, faster release cycles, lower incident remediation costs) and qualitative (e.g., improved developer productivity, enhanced security culture, reduced alert fatigue, better compliance).
- **Comprehensive TCO Analysis:** For agentic DevSecOps, thoroughly assess Total Cost of Ownership. This includes costs for agent development/licensing, necessary data infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and model retraining, specialized personnel, and establishing governance for agent behavior and decision-making.
- **Strategic Process Selection for Agents:** Identify DevSecOps processes where AI agents can deliver the most significant value. Consider factors like task repetitiveness, data availability for agent learning, potential for quality/speed improvement, and strategic security impact.
- **Prioritize Governance and Change Management:** The success of agentic DevSecOps heavily relies on establishing strong governance frameworks (e.g., for agent permissions, decision oversight, ethical considerations) and managing the cultural shift as human roles evolve alongside AI agents.
- **Emphasize IT Readiness and Collaboration:** Ensure IT and security teams are prepared for and collaborate on the integration and operation of AI agents within the DevSecOps toolchain and infrastructure.
