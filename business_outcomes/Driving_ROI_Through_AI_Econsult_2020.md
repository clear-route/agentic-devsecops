## Summary:
This ESI ThoughtLab report details a benchmarking study of 1,200 firms on achieving Return on Investment (ROI) with Artificial Intelligence (AI). It finds that while AI is vital for future success, many firms, especially those in early adoption stages, see modest or negative returns. The report stresses that AI's full potential is realized through strategic enterprise-wide integration, moving beyond cost savings to drive strategic gains like increased revenue and new business models. Robust data management, skilled talent, and a collaborative culture are crucial for maximizing AI ROI, with AI leaders investing more in people and processes alongside technology. Aligning AI strategies for operational efficiency and strong data security is key.

## Relevance to Agentic DevSecOps:
This document provides a crucial macro-view on achieving ROI with AI. Although not specific to DevSecOps agents, its principles are highly relevant. Agentic DevSecOps initiatives must demonstrate clear ROI by focusing on both operational efficiency (e.g., automating testing, deployment, monitoring) and strategic gains (e.g., enhanced security posture, faster secure releases, risk reduction). The report's emphasis on data-driven approaches, skilled teams, and effective scaling are directly applicable to developing and deploying AI agents in DevSecOps. High-ROI areas identified, such as IT operations and cybersecurity, are core domains for agentic DevSecOps solutions, validating their potential business impact.

## Key Takeaways / Actionable Insights:
- **Justify Agentic DevSecOps with Clear ROI:** Frame agentic solutions not just as technical upgrades but as drivers of measurable business value, encompassing cost savings, risk reduction, and speed/quality improvements.
- **Data is Foundational for Agents:** Effective DevSecOps agents will require robust, high-quality data pipelines (logs, metrics, code changes, threat intel) to learn and operate effectively. Invest in data management excellence.
- **Develop or Acquire Specialized Talent:** Building and managing sophisticated AI agents for DevSecOps requires specialized skills. Plan for talent acquisition and development.
- **Strategic Use Case Selection:** Apply agentic solutions to DevSecOps areas with the highest potential for impact, such as automating IT operational tasks, enhancing cybersecurity monitoring, and improving software quality assurance, as highlighted by the report's findings on high-ROI AI applications.
- **Adopt a Maturity Mindset:** View the integration of AI agents into DevSecOps as a journey. Use frameworks like the one in the report to benchmark progress and plan for scaling from initial pilots to enterprise-wide deployment.
- **Focus on Both Efficiency and Strategic Security:** AI agents in DevSecOps should aim to streamline processes (efficiency) and fundamentally improve the security and resilience of software delivery (strategic gain).
- **Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation of Agents:** Agentic systems, like other AI models, will require ongoing monitoring, performance measurement, and adaptation to remain effective as environments and threats evolve.
