**Category:** LLM Prompting Guidelines

## Key Topics Covered:
-   **GPT-4.1 Capabilities:** Enhanced performance in coding, instruction following, and long context (1M tokens) compared to GPT-4o.
-   **Prompt Migration:** Emphasis on literal instruction following in GPT-4.1, potentially requiring prompt adjustments from previous models.
-   **Agentic Workflows:**
    -   System Prompt Reminders: Importance of persistence, tool-calling encouragement, and optional explicit planning prompts for agentic tasks.
    -   Tool Call Best Practices: Using the API's `tools` field, clear tool naming and descriptions, and providing examples in the system prompt.
    -   Prompting-Induced Planning: Inducing step-by-step planning via prompts (model "thinking out loud") for non-reasoning models like GPT-4.1.
    -   Sample SWE-bench prompt demonstrating a detailed workflow strategy.
-   **Long Context Usage (1M Tokens):**
    -   Optimal context size considerations.
    -   Tuning context reliance (balancing external vs. internal knowledge).
    -   Prompt organization: Placing instructions at the beginning and end of long contexts for better performance.
-   **Chain of Thought (CoT):** Prompting for step-by-step reasoning to improve output quality, with examples for refining CoT prompts.
-   **Instruction Following:**
    -   Leveraging GPT-4.1's strong instruction-following by providing precise specifications.
    -   Recommended workflow for developing and debugging instructions (e.g., overall rules, specific sub-categories, examples).
    -   Common failure modes and mitigations (e.g., over-strict tool use instructions, repetitive sample phrases).
    -   Example customer service agent prompt.
-   **General Prompting Advice:**
    -   Recommended prompt structure (Role/Objective, Instructions, Reasoning Steps, Output Format, Examples, Context, Final Instructions).
    -   Use of delimiters (Markdown recommended, XML also performs well, JSON considerations).
    -   Specific delimiter guidance for long context document inputs (XML and a specific `ID | TITLE | CONTENT` format performed well; JSON poorly).
-   **Caveats:** Resistance to very long repetitive outputs, rare instances of incorrect parallel tool calls.
-   **Appendix:** Detailed guidance and reference implementation for generating and applying file diffs using a custom `apply_patch` tool and a specific V4A diff format.

## Summary:
This OpenAI Cookbook guide provides essential prompting tips for leveraging the advanced capabilities of the GPT-4.1 model family, which shows significant improvements in coding, instruction following, and handling long contexts (up to 1M tokens). The guide stresses that while many best practices persist, GPT-4.1's stricter adherence to literal instructions may necessitate prompt migration. Key areas covered include optimizing agentic workflows through specific system prompt reminders (persistence, tool use, planning), effective tool definition and API usage, and strategies for prompting-induced chain-of-thought. For long context tasks, it discusses optimal context usage, tuning the model's reliance on provided context versus its internal knowledge, and effective prompt organization. The guide also delves into maximizing GPT-4.1's strong instruction-following capabilities, offering a workflow for prompt development and debugging, and highlighting common pitfalls. General advice on prompt structure, the use of delimiters (Markdown and XML favored), and specific recommendations for formatting large document inputs are provided. An appendix offers a detailed method and reference implementation for generating and applying file diffs, a critical capability for coding tasks.

## Relevance to Agentic DevSecOps:
This guide is highly relevant for Agentic DevSecOps as it provides foundational knowledge for building sophisticated AI agents using state-of-the-art models like GPT-4.1. Many DevSecOps tasks involve complex instruction sets, interaction with code, use of external tools (security scanners, code analyzers, deployment scripts), and processing of extensive context (codebases, logs, threat intelligence reports). The principles outlined for agentic workflows, tool calling, long context handling, and precise instruction following are directly applicable to designing AI agents that can:
-   Autonomously analyze code for vulnerabilities (using the diffing/patching guidance).
-   Execute security tools and interpret their outputs.
-   Process and reason over large security logs or compliance documents.
-   Follow complex, multi-step security procedures or incident response playbooks.
-   Generate structured reports or remediation suggestions.

The guidance on prompting for planning and chain-of-thought is crucial for building agents that can perform complex reasoning steps inherent in many DevSecOps scenarios, such as root cause analysis of security incidents or planning remediation strategies.

## Key Takeaways / Actionable Insights:
-   **Embrace Explicit Instructions:** GPT-4.1's literal interpretation means DevSecOps agent prompts must be highly specific and unambiguous, especially for complex security policies or tool interactions.
-   **Structured Agent Prompts:** Utilize system prompt reminders for persistence, tool use, and planning when designing agents for DevSecOps tasks. This can make agents more "eager" and effective.
-   **Standardize Tool Integration:** Leverage the API's `tools` field for defining security tools for agents, ensuring clear naming and detailed descriptions for reliable execution.
-   **Long Context for Security Data:** The 1M token context window is a significant asset for DevSecOps agents that need to process large codebases, extensive logs, or comprehensive threat intelligence feeds. Follow prompt organization best practices (instructions at start and end).
-   **Induce Planning for Complex Security Logic:** For tasks requiring multi-step reasoning (e.g., incident investigation, vulnerability assessment), prompt GPT-4.1 to "think out loud" or follow an explicit reasoning strategy.
-   **Iterative Prompt Engineering for Security Agents:** AI engineering is empirical; build robust evaluation suites for DevSecOps agents and iterate on prompts based on performance against security-specific benchmarks or simulated scenarios.
-   **Diffing for Secure Code Modification:** The detailed appendix on `apply_patch` provides a strong foundation for agents that need to suggest or autonomously apply code fixes for vulnerabilities.
