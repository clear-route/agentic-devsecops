- **Automated Compliance Checks:** Across applications, integrations, vendors, and environments.
- **Automation of Routine CI/CD Tasks:** Build failure/success capture, alert generation, root cause analysis, predictive analytics, bug assignment, embedding security testing in DevOps.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Continuous feedback loops, enhanced Dev/Sec/Ops collaboration, automatic issue posting/tagging, data correlation for holistic views.

## Summary:
This presentation advocates for applying AI in DevSecOps to boost efficiency, security, and software delivery. It details business drivers and tech use cases for AI in the DevSecOps pipeline, showing how AI can tackle challenges like vast data processing, static workflows, and reactive monitoring. An experiment highlighted significant improvements: faster application delivery, fewer alerts/incidents, quicker security scans, and reduced false positives, emphasizing AI's transformative potential in DevSecOps.

## Relevance to Agentic DevSecOps:
This document is highly relevant as it directly outlines multiple areas within DevSecOps where AI, the core of agentic systems, can be applied to create intelligent automation and decision support. The described use cases, such as AI-driven alert management, root cause analysis, predictive analytics for potential build/deployment issues, and automated compliance checks, are prime candidates for implementation via autonomous or semi-autonomous AI agents. These agents could monitor, analyze, learn, and act upon data within the DevSecOps lifecycle, aligning perfectly with the goals of an agentic DevSecOps framework.

## Key Takeaways / Actionable Insights:
- **AI can significantly accelerate delivery and improve quality:** The experiment mentioned showed tangible benefits like faster delivery, fewer alerts, and quicker scans. This provides a strong case for investing in AI agents for specific DevSecOps tasks.
- **Focus on data-driven automation for CI/CD:** AI agents can automate routine CI/CD tasks by learning from historical build/deployment data, performing root cause analysis, and predicting potential issues.
- **Enhance security testing and compliance:** AI agents can be developed to automate compliance checks across various systems and improve the effectiveness of security testing by embedding it intelligently within the DevOps cycle.
- **Improve collaboration and decision-making:** Agentic systems can provide holistic views by correlating data from disparate sources, facilitating better collaboration and more informed decision-making for Dev, Sec, and Ops teams.
- **Proactive and Predictive Capabilities:** AI's ability to perform predictive analytics and identify defects proactively shifts DevSecOps from a reactive to a more proactive stance, a key goal for agentic systems.
