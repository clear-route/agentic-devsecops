# Agentic DevSecOps Knowledge Repository

Welcome to the Agentic DevSecOps Knowledge Repository! This curated collection of documents aims to be a central hub for research, practical implementation examples, business outcome analyses, and guided learning related to the application of AI agents and agentic systems in DevSecOps.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:
-   To **centralize valuable information** on the rapidly evolving field of Agentic DevSecOps.
-   To **upskill individuals and teams** across various roles by providing targeted learning paths.
-   To **foster innovation** by sharing insights into current research, successful implementations, and the business value of leveraging AI agents for enhanced security and efficiency in software development and operations.
-   To **provide a foundational knowledge base** for our company as we explore and adopt agentic technologies in our DevSecOps practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

-   `/learning_material`: Contains summaries of diverse learning resources, including YouTube videos, GitHub repository overviews, and practical guides (like the OpenAI Cookbook prompting guide). This is a good starting point for exploring various topics related to AI, agents, and DevSecOps.
-   `/foundational_ai_content`: Houses key foundational documents, often in PDF format with detailed summaries, focusing on core AI concepts, prompting strategies, and official guides (e.g., Google's Gemini Prompting Guide).
-   `/guides_for_personas`: Provides tailored reading guides for different roles within our organization, helping individuals navigate this repository based on their specific interests and learning objectives.
-   `/research_papers`: Contains academic papers and technical reports. (Note: This folder was part of the initial structure; some newer relevant research summaries may be found in `/learning_material` or `/foundational_ai_content` based on processing history.)
-   `/implementation_examples`: Features practical guides and case studies. (Note: This folder was part of the initial structure; some newer relevant implementation examples or framework summaries may be found in `/learning_material`.)
-   `/business_outcomes`: Includes reports and analyses on ROI and business value. (Note: This folder was part of the initial structure; newer relevant content might be in `/learning_material`.)

**Note on Summaries**: Most documents processed into `/learning_material` and `/foundational_ai_content` are Markdown (`.md`) summaries. For PDFs in `/foundational_ai_content`, the original PDF is stored alongside its summary. Some original PDF documents from the initial setup in `/research_papers`, `/implementation_examples`, and `/business_outcomes` may also have accompanying summaries.

## Highlights of Recent Additions

This repository has been recently updated with a wealth of new information:
