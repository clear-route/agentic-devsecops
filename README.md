# Agentic DevSecOps Knowledge Repository

Welcome to the Agentic DevSecOps Knowledge Repository! This curated collection of documents aims to be a central hub for research, practical implementation examples, business outcome analyses, and guided learning related to the application of AI agents and agentic systems in DevSecOps.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:
-   To **centralize valuable information** on the rapidly evolving field of Agentic DevSecOps.
-   To **upskill individuals and teams** across various roles by providing targeted learning paths.
-   To **foster innovation** by sharing insights into current research, successful implementations, and the business value of leveraging AI agents for enhanced security and efficiency in software development and operations.
-   To **provide a foundational knowledge base** for our company as we explore and adopt agentic technologies in our DevSecOps practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

-   `/research_papers`: Contains academic papers, technical reports, and foundational research articles discussing the theoretical underpinnings, landscape, governance, and future opportunities for AI agents in DevSecOps and related fields.
-   `/implementation_examples`: Features practical guides, case studies, how-to documents, and examples of implementing DevSecOps principles, security automation, and AI agent development.
-   `/business_outcomes`: Includes reports, analyses, and discussions on the Return on Investment (ROI), economic impacts, and overall business value derived from applying AI and intelligent automation in cybersecurity and software development operations.
-   `/guides_for_personas`: Provides tailored reading guides for different roles within our organization, helping individuals navigate this repository based on their specific interests and learning objectives.

**Note on Summaries**: Most PDF documents in the `research_papers`, `implementation_examples`, and `business_outcomes` folders are accompanied by a Markdown (`.md`) summary file. These summaries provide a quick overview, key takeaways, and relevance to Agentic DevSecOps. Some PDFs were downloaded but could not be automatically summarized due to access restrictions on their source URLs; these are included for completeness.
