## Key Topics Covered:
- Comprehensive review of AI-driven security techniques in DevSecOps (2017-2023).
- Application of AI (LLMs, agentic systems) for vulnerability detection, classification, repair, and anomaly detection.
- Role of AI in automating time-consuming security processes and shifting security left.
- Challenges: data imbalance, model explainability (XAI), lack of AI security tooling in IDEs/CI/CD.
- Future Opportunities: meta-learning, advanced LLMs for data handling, XAI development, broader deployment of AI tools, transformer variants, multi-agent systems for distributed anomaly detection (especially in CPS).

## Summary:
This paper explores the growing intersection of AI and DevSecOps, reviewing 99 research papers (2017-2023) to discuss AI-driven security techniques across the DevOps workflow. It emphasizes how AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic systems, can automate and enhance tasks like vulnerability management and anomaly detection to maintain agility. The paper highlights AI's potential to automate security processes, address integration challenges, and enable proactive security by shifting security earlier in the development lifecycle. Key research areas include software vulnerability detection/repair and log analysis using LLMs and deep learning. The paper also discusses challenges like data imbalance, model explainability, and tooling integration, alongside future opportunities like advanced LLMs, XAI, and multi-agent systems.

## Relevance to Agentic DevSecOps:
This paper is highly relevant as it directly surveys the landscape of AI in DevSecOps, explicitly mentioning the role of LLMs and the potential for multi-agent systems. It provides a strong academic foundation for understanding how agentic systems can be designed to address specific security tasks within the DevSecOps pipeline. The identified challenges (e.g., explainability, data imbalance) are critical considerations for developing robust and trustworthy AI agents, while the future opportunities (e.g., multi-agent systems for anomaly detection, LLM-driven vulnerability repair) point directly to areas where agentic DevSecOps solutions can make significant contributions.

## Key Takeaways / Actionable Insights:
- **Agentic systems must address data challenges:** The problem of data imbalance in vulnerability datasets is a key challenge; agentic solutions should explore techniques like meta-learning or few-shot learning, potentially leveraging advanced LLMs as discussed.
- **Explainability is crucial for adoption:** For AI agents to be trusted in security-critical DevSecOps tasks, their decisions must be explainable. Investing in XAI capabilities within agentic systems is essential.
- **Integrate AI agents into developer workflows:** The lack of AI security tooling in IDEs and CI/CD pipelines is a barrier. Agentic DevSecOps platforms should prioritize seamless integration to provide real-time assistance and feedback.
- **Leverage LLMs for code-related tasks:** LLMs show significant promise for vulnerability detection, classification, and automated repair. AI agents can be built around these capabilities.
- **Explore multi-agent systems for complex environments:** For distributed anomaly detection in areas like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) or complex microservice architectures, multi-agent approaches offer a promising future direction.
- **Focus on proactive security:** AI agents can help shift security left by automating early-stage vulnerability detection and providing continuous feedback, aligning with the core principles of DevSecOps.
