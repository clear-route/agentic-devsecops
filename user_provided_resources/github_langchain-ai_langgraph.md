## Core Purpose (from README.md):
LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents. It is trusted by companies like Klarna, Replit, and Elastic.

## Key Features/Benefits (from README.md):
-   **Durable Execution:** Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, automatically resuming from where they left off.
-   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point during execution.
-   **Comprehensive Memory:** Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory and long-term persistent memory across sessions.
-   **Debugging with LangSmith:** Gain deep visibility into agent behavior with visualization tools for tracing execution paths, capturing state transitions, and runtime metrics.
-   **Production-Ready Deployment:** Deploy sophisticated agent systems with scalable infrastructure designed for stateful, long-running workflows.

## Ecosystem (from README.md):
LangGraph can be used standalone or integrated with LangChain products:
-   **LangSmith:** For agent evaluation, observability, debugging, and performance improvement.
-   **LangGraph Platform:** For deploying and scaling agents, discovering, reusing, configuring, and sharing agents across teams. Includes **LangGraph Studio** for visual prototyping.
-   **LangChain:** Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development.

*Note: A JavaScript version is also available at `https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs`.*

## Installation (from README.md):
```bash
pip install -U langgraph
```

## Quick Start Example (from README.md):
```python
# pip install -qU "langchain[anthropic]" to call the model
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```
